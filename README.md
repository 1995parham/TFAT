# TFAT
## Introduction
TOs kernel FAT16 & FAT32 filesystem parser and handler with interactive shell  

This project was originally written for assembly programming course at
[Amirkabir university](http://www.aut.ac.ir).
This project was completely written by C under ubuntu with gcc.  

In this project we use kernel-coding style from Linus Torvalds and
use some script from kernel to validate our code against that.

Some TFAT features include:

1. FAT type detection
2. Support FAT16 & FAT32
3. Delete & Un-delete
4. ls & cd & dump ... commands  
&...
